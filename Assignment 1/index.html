            <h1>JESUS CHRIST</h1>
            <h2>The Living God</h2>

                Jesus Christ is the son of God and our saviour in all circumtances.
                He is the one to help us get washed of our sins and renew our spirits.I admire him a lot because he has
            helped me get through hard times as well as he has always shown a right path to take.</p>
            <p>Jesus was asked what was really important in life (the greatest commandment) and he responded with a very simple value 
                system: “Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind and with all your strength.
                 The second is this: ‘Love your neighbor as yourself. There is no commandment greater than these.”  The core of Jesus’ values 
                 are found in this statement. Our reaching out, reaching in, and reaching up to God the Father and his son Jesus Christ is the
                  primary value of Jesus. Reaching out to love the people God brings across our path is the other side of Jesus’ value system.
                 So clear, so simple and so hard!</p>
                 <p>Jesus always preached for hope, faith and love. But love is the greatest amongst all. Therefore we all
                    should love each other and praise the most high God for that is his will and his will shall be done.Jesus 
                teaches us to have faith and rely on him rather than relying on our own understanding. And that's what all should do
            and walk on the way he has showed us.</p>
            <p>A Disciple Is Patient, Kind, and Gentle

                Consequently, the Bible also calls us to be patient, kind, and gentle. We do this 
                by bearing HIS fruit in our lives (Galatians 5:22). When we allow His fruit to grow i
                n our lives, our actions naturally become more patient, kind, and gentle.</p>
                <p>So allow him to guide you and be his disciples.</p>
